# bizmates-exam examplanation

I used Vue.js for the frontend in combination with a Laravel backend to create an efficient and user-friendly application that significantly enhances the user experience. This setup allows users to easily input a city, after which the application fetches and displays venue listings in an organized manner. Users can then click on individual venues to view detailed information in a modal, which helps maintain a clean and uncluttered UI. This approach not only provides a smooth and interactive experience but also allows users to quickly access relevant details without overwhelming them with information on the main screen, ultimately making the application more intuitive and accessible.
